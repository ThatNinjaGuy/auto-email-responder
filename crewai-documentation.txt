# Agents

What are CrewAI Agents and how to use them.

## What is an agent?

An agent is an **autonomous unit** programmed to:

<ul>
  <li class="leading-3">Perform tasks</li>
  <li class="leading-3">Make decisions</li>
  <li class="leading-3">Communicate with other agents</li>
</ul>

<Tip>
  Think of an agent as a member of a team, with specific skills and a particular job to do. Agents can have different roles like `Researcher`, `Writer`, or `Customer Support`, each contributing to the overall goal of the crew.

## Creating an agent

<Note>
  **Agent interaction**: Agents can interact with each other using CrewAI's built-in delegation and communication mechanisms. This allows for dynamic task management and problem-solving within the crew.
</Note>

To create an agent, you would typically initialize an instance of the `Agent` class with the desired properties. Here's a conceptual example including all attributes:

```python Code example
from crewai import Agent

agent = Agent(
  role='Data Analyst',
  goal='Extract actionable insights',
  backstory="""You're a data analyst at a large company.
    You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights
    to the business.
    You're currently working on a project to analyze the
    performance of our marketing campaigns.""",
  tools=[my_tool1, my_tool2],  # Optional, defaults to an empty list
  llm=my_llm,  # Optional
  function_calling_llm=my_llm,  # Optional
  max_iter=15,  # Optional
  max_rpm=None, # Optional
  max_execution_time=None, # Optional
  verbose=True,  # Optional
  allow_delegation=False,  # Optional
  step_callback=my_intermediate_step_callback,  # Optional
  cache=True,  # Optional
  system_template=my_system_template,  # Optional
  prompt_template=my_prompt_template,  # Optional
  response_template=my_response_template,  # Optional
  config=my_config,  # Optional
  crew=my_crew,  # Optional
  tools_handler=my_tools_handler,  # Optional
  cache_handler=my_cache_handler,  # Optional
  callbacks=[callback1, callback2],  # Optional
  allow_code_execution=True,  # Optional
  max_retry_limit=2,  # Optional
  use_system_prompt=True,  # Optional
  respect_context_window=True,  # Optional
  code_execution_mode='safe',  # Optional, defaults to 'safe'
)
```

## Setting prompt templates

Prompt templates are used to format the prompt for the agent. You can use to update the system, regular and response templates for the agent. Here's an example of how to set prompt templates:

```python Code example
agent = Agent(
        role="{topic} specialist",
        goal="Figure {goal} out",
        backstory="I am the master of {role}",
        system_template="""<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
                        {{ .System }}<|eot_id|>""",
        prompt_template="""<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
                        {{ .Prompt }}<|eot_id|>""",
        response_template="""<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
                        {{ .Response }}<|eot_id|>""",
)
```

## Bring your third-party agents

Extend your third-party agents like LlamaIndex, Langchain, Autogen or fully custom agents using the the CrewAI's `BaseAgent` class.

<Note>
  **BaseAgent** includes attributes and methods required to integrate with your crews to run and delegate tasks to other agents within your own crew.
</Note>

CrewAI is a universal multi-agent framework that allows for all agents to work together to automate tasks and solve problems.

```python Code example
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from custom_agent import CustomAgent # You need to build and extend your own agent logic with the CrewAI BaseAgent class then import it here.

from langchain.agents import load_tools

langchain_tools = load_tools(["google-serper"], llm=llm)

agent1 = CustomAgent(
    role="agent role",
    goal="who is {input}?",
    backstory="agent backstory",
    verbose=True,
)

task1 = Task(
    expected_output="a short biography of {input}",
    description="a short biography of {input}",
    agent=agent1,
)

agent2 = Agent(
    role="agent role",
    goal="summarize the short bio for {input} and if needed do more research",
    backstory="agent backstory",
    verbose=True,
)

task2 = Task(
    description="a tldr summary of the short biography",
    expected_output="5 bullet point summary of the biography",
    agent=agent2,
    context=[task1],
)

my_crew = Crew(agents=[agent1, agent2], tasks=[task1, task2])
crew = my_crew.kickoff(inputs={"input": "Mark Twain"})
```

## Conclusion

Agents are the building blocks of the CrewAI framework. By understanding how to define and interact with agents,
you can create sophisticated AI systems that leverage the power of collaborative intelligence. The `code_execution_mode` attribute provides flexibility in how agents execute code, allowing for both secure and direct execution options.

| **json**        | Returns the JSON string representation of the crew output if the output format is JSON.           |
| **to\_dict**    | Converts the JSON and Pydantic outputs to a dictionary.                                           |
| \***\*str\*\*** | Returns the string representation of the crew output, prioritizing Pydantic, then JSON, then raw. |

### Accessing Crew Outputs

Once a crew has been executed, its output can be accessed through the `output` attribute of the `Crew` object. The `CrewOutput` class provides various ways to interact with and present this output.

#### Example

```python Code
# Example crew execution
crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent, writer_agent],
    tasks=[research_task, write_article_task],
    verbose=True
)

crew_output = crew.kickoff()

# Accessing the crew output
print(f"Raw Output: {crew_output.raw}")
if crew_output.json_dict:
    print(f"JSON Output: {json.dumps(crew_output.json_dict, indent=2)}")
if crew_output.pydantic:
    print(f"Pydantic Output: {crew_output.pydantic}")
print(f"Tasks Output: {crew_output.tasks_output}")
print(f"Token Usage: {crew_output.token_usage}")
```

## Memory Utilization

Crews can utilize memory (short-term, long-term, and entity memory) to enhance their execution and learning over time. This feature allows crews to store and recall execution memories, aiding in decision-making and task execution strategies.

## Cache Utilization

Caches can be employed to store the results of tools' execution, making the process more efficient by reducing the need to re-execute identical tasks.

## Crew Usage Metrics

After the crew execution, you can access the `usage_metrics` attribute to view the language model (LLM) usage metrics for all tasks executed by the crew. This provides insights into operational efficiency and areas for improvement.

```python Code
# Access the crew's usage metrics
crew = Crew(agents=[agent1, agent2], tasks=[task1, task2])
crew.kickoff()
print(crew.usage_metrics)
```

## Crew Execution Process

*   **Sequential Process**: Tasks are executed one after another, allowing for a linear flow of work.
*   **Hierarchical Process**: A manager agent coordinates the crew, delegating tasks and validating outcomes before proceeding. **Note**: A `manager_llm` or `manager_agent` is required for this process and it's essential for validating the process flow.

### Kicking Off a Crew

Once your crew is assembled, initiate the workflow with the `kickoff()` method. This starts the execution process according to the defined process flow.

```python Code
# Start the crew's task execution
result = my_crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```

### Different Ways to Kick Off a Crew

Once your crew is assembled, initiate the workflow with the appropriate kickoff method. CrewAI provides several methods for better control over the kickoff process: `kickoff()`, `kickoff_for_each()`, `kickoff_async()`, and `kickoff_for_each_async()`.

*   `kickoff()`: Starts the execution process according to the defined process flow.
*   `kickoff_for_each()`: Executes tasks for each agent individually.
*   `kickoff_async()`: Initiates the workflow asynchronously.
*   `kickoff_for_each_async()`: Executes tasks for each agent individually in an asynchronous manner.

```python Code
# Start the crew's task execution
result = my_crew.kickoff()
print(result)

# Example of using kickoff_for_each
inputs_array = [{'topic': 'AI in healthcare'}, {'topic': 'AI in finance'}]
results = my_crew.kickoff_for_each(inputs=inputs_array)
for result in results:
    print(result)

# Example of using kickoff_async
inputs = {'topic': 'AI in healthcare'}
async_result = my_crew.kickoff_async(inputs=inputs)
print(async_result)

# Example of using kickoff_for_each_async
inputs_array = [{'topic': 'AI in healthcare'}, {'topic': 'AI in finance'}]
async_results = my_crew.kickoff_for_each_async(inputs=inputs_array)
for async_result in async_results:
    print(async_result)
```

These methods provide flexibility in how you manage and execute tasks within your crew, allowing for both synchronous and asynchronous workflows tailored to your needs.

### Replaying from a Specific Task

You can now replay from a specific task using our CLI command `replay`.

The replay feature in CrewAI allows you to replay from a specific task using the command-line interface (CLI). By running the command `crewai replay -t <task_id>`, you can specify the `task_id` for the replay process.

Kickoffs will now save the latest kickoffs returned task outputs locally for you to be able to replay from.

### Replaying from a Specific Task Using the CLI

To use the replay feature, follow these steps:

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where your CrewAI project is located.
3.  Run the following command:

To view the latest kickoff task IDs, use:

```shell
crewai log-tasks-outputs
```

Then, to replay from a specific task, use:

```shell
crewai replay -t <task_id>
```

These commands let you replay from your latest kickoff tasks, still retaining context from previously executed tasks.


# Flows

Learn how to create and manage AI workflows using CrewAI Flows.

## Introduction

CrewAI Flows is a powerful feature designed to streamline the creation and management of AI workflows. Flows allow developers to combine and coordinate coding tasks and Crews efficiently, providing a robust framework for building sophisticated AI automations.

Flows allow you to create structured, event-driven workflows. They provide a seamless way to connect multiple tasks, manage state, and control the flow of execution in your AI applications. With Flows, you can easily design and implement multi-step processes that leverage the full potential of CrewAI's capabilities.

1.  **Simplified Workflow Creation**: Easily chain together multiple Crews and tasks to create complex AI workflows.

2.  **State Management**: Flows make it super easy to manage and share state between different tasks in your workflow.

3.  **Event-Driven Architecture**: Built on an event-driven model, allowing for dynamic and responsive workflows.

4.  **Flexible Control Flow**: Implement conditional logic, loops, and branching within your workflows.

5.  **Input Flexibility**: Flows can accept inputs to initialize or update their state, with different handling for structured and unstructured state management.

## Getting Started

Let's create a simple Flow where you will use OpenAI to generate a random city in one task and then use that city to generate a fun fact in another task.

### Passing Inputs to Flows

Flows can accept inputs to initialize or update their state before execution. The way inputs are handled depends on whether the flow uses structured or unstructured state management.

#### Structured State Management

In structured state management, the flow's state is defined using a Pydantic `BaseModel`. Inputs must match the model's schema, and any updates will overwrite the default values.

```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ExampleState(BaseModel):
    counter: int = 0
    message: str = ""

class StructuredExampleFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):
    @start()
    def first_method(self):
        # Implementation

flow = StructuredExampleFlow()
flow.kickoff(inputs={"counter": 10})
```

In this example, the `counter` is initialized to `10`, while `message` retains its default value.

#### Unstructured State Management

In unstructured state management, the flow's state is a dictionary. You can pass any dictionary to update the state.

```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start

class UnstructuredExampleFlow(Flow):
    @start()
    def first_method(self):
        # Implementation

flow = UnstructuredExampleFlow()
flow.kickoff(inputs={"counter": 5, "message": "Initial message"})
```

Here, both `counter` and `message` are updated based on the provided inputs.

**Note:** Ensure that inputs for structured state management adhere to the defined schema to avoid validation errors.

### Example Flow

```python
# Existing example code
```

In the above example, we have created a simple Flow that generates a random city using OpenAI and then generates a fun fact about that city. The Flow consists of two tasks: `generate_city` and `generate_fun_fact`. The `generate_city` task is the starting point of the Flow, and the `generate_fun_fact` task listens for the output of the `generate_city` task.

When you run the Flow, it will generate a random city and then generate a fun fact about that city. The output will be printed to the console.

**Note:** Ensure you have set up your `.env` file to store your `OPENAI_API_KEY`. This key is necessary for authenticating requests to the OpenAI API.

### @start()

The `@start()` decorator is used to mark a method as the starting point of a Flow. When a Flow is started, all the methods decorated with `@start()` are executed in parallel. You can have multiple start methods in a Flow, and they will all be executed when the Flow is started.

### @listen()

The `@listen()` decorator is used to mark a method as a listener for the output of another task in the Flow. The method decorated with `@listen()` will be executed when the specified task emits an output. The method can access the output of the task it is listening to as an argument.

#### Usage

The `@listen()` decorator can be used in several ways:

1.  **Listening to a Method by Name**: You can pass the name of the method you want to listen to as a string. When that method completes, the listener method will be triggered.

    ```python
    @listen("generate_city")
    def generate_fun_fact(self, random_city):
        # Implementation
    ```

2.  **Listening to a Method Directly**: You can pass the method itself. When that method completes, the listener method will be triggered.
    ```python
    @listen(generate_city)
    def generate_fun_fact(self, random_city):
        # Implementation
    ```

### Flow Output

Accessing and handling the output of a Flow is essential for integrating your AI workflows into larger applications or systems. CrewAI Flows provide straightforward mechanisms to retrieve the final output, access intermediate results, and manage the overall state of your Flow.

#### Retrieving the Final Output

When you run a Flow, the final output is determined by the last method that completes. The `kickoff()` method returns the output of this final method.

Here's how you can access the final output:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python
  from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start

  class OutputExampleFlow(Flow):
      @start()
      def first_method(self):
          return "Output from first_method"

      @listen(first_method)
      def second_method(self, first_output):
          return f"Second method received: {first_output}"

  flow = OutputExampleFlow()
  final_output = flow.kickoff()

  print("---- Final Output ----")
  print(final_output)
  ```

  ```text
  ---- Final Output ----
  Second method received: Output from first_method
  ```
</CodeGroup>

In this example, the `second_method` is the last method to complete, so its output will be the final output of the Flow.
The `kickoff()` method will return the final output, which is then printed to the console.

#### Accessing and Updating State

In addition to retrieving the final output, you can also access and update the state within your Flow. The state can be used to store and share data between different methods in the Flow. After the Flow has run, you can access the state to retrieve any information that was added or updated during the execution.

Here's an example of how to update and access the state:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python
  from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
  from pydantic import BaseModel

  class ExampleState(BaseModel):
      counter: int = 0
      message: str = ""

  class StateExampleFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):

      @start()
      def first_method(self):
          self.state.message = "Hello from first_method"
          self.state.counter += 1

      @listen(first_method)
      def second_method(self):
          self.state.message += " - updated by second_method"
          self.state.counter += 1
          return self.state.message

  flow = StateExampleFlow()
  final_output = flow.kickoff()
  print(f"Final Output: {final_output}")
  print("Final State:")
  print(flow.state)
  ```

  ```text
  Final Output: Hello from first_method - updated by second_method
  Final State:
  counter=2 message='Hello from first_method - updated by second_method'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

In this example, the state is updated by both `first_method` and `second_method`.
After the Flow has run, you can access the final state to see the updates made by these methods.

By ensuring that the final method's output is returned and providing access to the state, CrewAI Flows make it easy to integrate the results of your AI workflows into larger applications or systems,
while also maintaining and accessing the state throughout the Flow's execution.

## Flow State Management

Managing state effectively is crucial for building reliable and maintainable AI workflows. CrewAI Flows provides robust mechanisms for both unstructured and structured state management,
allowing developers to choose the approach that best fits their application's needs.

### Unstructured State Management

In unstructured state management, all state is stored in the `state` attribute of the `Flow` class.
This approach offers flexibility, enabling developers to add or modify state attributes on the fly without defining a strict schema.

```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start

class UnstructuredExampleFlow(Flow):

    @start()
    def first_method(self):
        self.state.message = "Hello from structured flow"
        self.state.counter = 0

    @listen(first_method)
    def second_method(self):
        self.state.counter += 1
        self.state.message += " - updated"

    @listen(second_method)
    def third_method(self):
        self.state.counter += 1
        self.state.message += " - updated again"

        print(f"State after third_method: {self.state}")

flow = UnstructuredExampleFlow()
flow.kickoff()
```

**Key Points:**

*   **Flexibility:** You can dynamically add attributes to `self.state` without predefined constraints.
*   **Simplicity:** Ideal for straightforward workflows where state structure is minimal or varies significantly.

### Structured State Management

Structured state management leverages predefined schemas to ensure consistency and type safety across the workflow.
By using models like Pydantic's `BaseModel`, developers can define the exact shape of the state, enabling better validation and auto-completion in development environments.

```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ExampleState(BaseModel):
    counter: int = 0
    message: str = ""

class StructuredExampleFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):

    @start()
    def first_method(self):
        self.state.message = "Hello from structured flow"

    @listen(first_method)
    def second_method(self):
        self.state.counter += 1
        self.state.message += " - updated"

    @listen(second_method)
    def third_method(self):
        self.state.counter += 1
        self.state.message += " - updated again"

        print(f"State after third_method: {self.state}")

flow = StructuredExampleFlow()
flow.kickoff()
```

**Key Points:**

*   **Defined Schema:** `ExampleState` clearly outlines the state structure, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
*   **Type Safety:** Leveraging Pydantic ensures that state attributes adhere to the specified types, reducing runtime errors.
*   **Auto-Completion:** IDEs can provide better auto-completion and error checking based on the defined state model.

### Choosing Between Unstructured and Structured State Management

*   **Use Unstructured State Management when:**

    *   The workflow's state is simple or highly dynamic.
    *   Flexibility is prioritized over strict state definitions.
    *   Rapid prototyping is required without the overhead of defining schemas.

*   **Use Structured State Management when:**
    *   The workflow requires a well-defined and consistent state structure.
    *   Type safety and validation are important for your application's reliability.
    *   You want to leverage IDE features like auto-completion and type checking for better developer experience.

By providing both unstructured and structured state management options, CrewAI Flows empowers developers to build AI workflows that are both flexible and robust, catering to a wide range of application requirements.

## Flow Control

### Conditional Logic: `or`

The `or_` function in Flows allows you to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method when any of the specified methods emit an output.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python
  from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, or_, start

  class OrExampleFlow(Flow):

      @start()
      def start_method(self):
          return "Hello from the start method"

      @listen(start_method)
      def second_method(self):
          return "Hello from the second method"

      @listen(or_(start_method, second_method))
      def logger(self, result):
          print(f"Logger: {result}")

  flow = OrExampleFlow()
  flow.kickoff()
  ```

  ```text
  Logger: Hello from the start method
  Logger: Hello from the second method
  ```
</CodeGroup>

When you run this Flow, the `logger` method will be triggered by the output of either the `start_method` or the `second_method`.
The `or_` function is used to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method when any of the specified methods emit an output.

### Conditional Logic: `and`

The `and_` function in Flows allows you to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method only when all the specified methods emit an output.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python
  from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, and_, listen, start

  class AndExampleFlow(Flow):

      @start()
      def start_method(self):
          self.state["greeting"] = "Hello from the start method"

      @listen(start_method)
      def second_method(self):
          self.state["joke"] = "What do computers eat? Microchips."

      @listen(and_(start_method, second_method))
      def logger(self):
          print("---- Logger ----")
          print(self.state)

  flow = AndExampleFlow()
  flow.kickoff()
  ```

  ```text
  ---- Logger ----
  {'greeting': 'Hello from the start method', 'joke': 'What do computers eat? Microchips.'}
  ```
</CodeGroup>

When you run this Flow, the `logger` method will be triggered only when both the `start_method` and the `second_method` emit an output.
The `and_` function is used to listen to multiple methods and trigger the listener method only when all the specified methods emit an output.

### Router

The `@router()` decorator in Flows allows you to define conditional routing logic based on the output of a method.
You can specify different routes based on the output of the method, allowing you to control the flow of execution dynamically.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python
  import random
  from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, router, start
  from pydantic import BaseModel

  class ExampleState(BaseModel):
      success_flag: bool = False

  class RouterFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):

      @start()
      def start_method(self):
          print("Starting the structured flow")
          random_boolean = random.choice([True, False])
          self.state.success_flag = random_boolean

      @router(start_method)
      def second_method(self):
          if self.state.success_flag:
              return "success"
          else:
              return "failed"

      @listen("success")
      def third_method(self):
          print("Third method running")

      @listen("failed")
      def fourth_method(self):
          print("Fourth method running")

  flow = RouterFlow()
  flow.kickoff()
  ```

  ```text
  Starting the structured flow
  Third method running
  Fourth method running
  ```
</CodeGroup>

In the above example, the `start_method` generates a random boolean value and sets it in the state.
The `second_method` uses the `@router()` decorator to define conditional routing logic based on the value of the boolean.
If the boolean is `True`, the method returns `"success"`, and if it is `False`, the method returns `"failed"`.
The `third_method` and `fourth_method` listen to the output of the `second_method` and execute based on the returned value.

When you run this Flow, the output will change based on the random boolean value generated by the `start_method`.

## Adding Crews to Flows

Creating a flow with multiple crews in CrewAI is straightforward.

You can generate a new CrewAI project that includes all the scaffolding needed to create a flow with multiple crews by running the following command:

```bash
crewai create flow name_of_flow
```

This command will generate a new CrewAI project with the necessary folder structure. The generated project includes a prebuilt crew called `poem_crew` that is already working. You can use this crew as a template by copying, pasting, and editing it to create other crews.

### Folder Structure

After running the `crewai create flow name_of_flow` command, you will see a folder structure similar to the following:

| Directory/File         | Description                                                         |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name_of_flow/`        | Root directory for the flow.                                        |
| ├── `crews/`           | Contains directories for specific crews.                            |
| │ └── `poem_crew/`     | Directory for the "poem\_crew" with its configurations and scripts. |
| │ ├── `config/`        | Configuration files directory for the "poem\_crew".                 |
| │ │ ├── `agents.yaml`  | YAML file defining the agents for "poem\_crew".                     |
| │ │ └── `tasks.yaml`   | YAML file defining the tasks for "poem\_crew".                      |
| │ ├── `poem_crew.py`   | Script for "poem\_crew" functionality.                              |
| ├── `tools/`           | Directory for additional tools used in the flow.                    |
| │ └── `custom_tool.py` | Custom tool implementation.                                         |
| ├── `main.py`          | Main script for running the flow.                                   |
| ├── `README.md`        | Project description and instructions.                               |
| ├── `pyproject.toml`   | Configuration file for project dependencies and settings.           |
| └── `.gitignore`       | Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control.       |

### Building Your Crews

In the `crews` folder, you can define multiple crews. Each crew will have its own folder containing configuration files and the crew definition file. For example, the `poem_crew` folder contains:

*   `config/agents.yaml`: Defines the agents for the crew.
*   `config/tasks.yaml`: Defines the tasks for the crew.
*   `poem_crew.py`: Contains the crew definition, including agents, tasks, and the crew itself.

You can copy, paste, and edit the `poem_crew` to create other crews.

### Connecting Crews in `main.py`

The `main.py` file is where you create your flow and connect the crews together. You can define your flow by using the `Flow` class and the decorators `@start` and `@listen` to specify the flow of execution.

Here's an example of how you can connect the `poem_crew` in the `main.py` file:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from random import randint

from pydantic import BaseModel
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from .crews.poem_crew.poem_crew import PoemCrew

class PoemState(BaseModel):
    sentence_count: int = 1
    poem: str = ""

class PoemFlow(Flow[PoemState]):

    @start()
    def generate_sentence_count(self):
        print("Generating sentence count")
        self.state.sentence_count = randint(1, 5)

    @listen(generate_sentence_count)
    def generate_poem(self):
        print("Generating poem")
        result = PoemCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs={"sentence_count": self.state.sentence_count})

        print("Poem generated", result.raw)
        self.state.poem = result.raw

    @listen(generate_poem)
    def save_poem(self):
        print("Saving poem")
        with open("poem.txt", "w") as f:
            f.write(self.state.poem)

def kickoff():
    poem_flow = PoemFlow()
    poem_flow.kickoff()


def plot():
    poem_flow = PoemFlow()
    poem_flow.plot()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    kickoff()
```

In this example, the `PoemFlow` class defines a flow that generates a sentence count, uses the `PoemCrew` to generate a poem, and then saves the poem to a file. The flow is kicked off by calling the `kickoff()` method.

### Running the Flow

(Optional) Before running the flow, you can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
crewai install
```

Once all of the dependencies are installed, you need to activate the virtual environment by running:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

After activating the virtual environment, you can run the flow by executing one of the following commands:

```bash
crewai flow kickoff
```

or

```bash
uv run kickoff
```

The flow will execute, and you should see the output in the console.

### Adding Additional Crews Using the CLI

Once you have created your initial flow, you can easily add additional crews to your project using the CLI. This allows you to expand your flow's capabilities by integrating new crews without starting from scratch.

To add a new crew to your existing flow, use the following command:

```bash
crewai flow add-crew <crew_name>
```

This command will create a new directory for your crew within the `crews` folder of your flow project. It will include the necessary configuration files and a crew definition file, similar to the initial setup.

#### Folder Structure

After adding a new crew, your folder structure will look like this:

| Directory/File               | Description                                                         |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name_of_flow/`              | Root directory for the flow.                                        |
| ├── `crews/`                 | Contains directories for specific crews.                            |

You can then customize the `agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml` files to define the agents and tasks for your new crew. The `name_of_crew.py` file will contain the crew's logic, which you can modify to suit your needs.

By using the CLI to add additional crews, you can efficiently build complex AI workflows that leverage multiple crews working together.

## Plot Flows

Visualizing your AI workflows can provide valuable insights into the structure and execution paths of your flows. CrewAI offers a powerful visualization tool that allows you to generate interactive plots of your flows, making it easier to understand and optimize your AI workflows.

### What are Plots?

Plots in CrewAI are graphical representations of your AI workflows. They display the various tasks, their connections, and the flow of data between them. This visualization helps in understanding the sequence of operations, identifying bottlenecks, and ensuring that the workflow logic aligns with your expectations.

### How to Generate a Plot

CrewAI provides two convenient methods to generate plots of your flows:

#### Option 1: Using the `plot()` Method

If you are working directly with a flow instance, you can generate a plot by calling the `plot()` method on your flow object. This method will create an HTML file containing the interactive plot of your flow.

```python
# Assuming you have a flow instance
flow.plot("my_flow_plot")
```

This will generate a file named `my_flow_plot.html` in your current directory. You can open this file in a web browser to view the interactive plot.

#### Option 2: Using the Command Line

If you are working within a structured CrewAI project, you can generate a plot using the command line. This is particularly useful for larger projects where you want to visualize the entire flow setup.

```bash
crewai flow plot
```

This command will generate an HTML file with the plot of your flow, similar to the `plot()` method. The file will be saved in your project directory, and you can open it in a web browser to explore the flow.

### Understanding the Plot

The generated plot will display nodes representing the tasks in your flow, with directed edges indicating the flow of execution. The plot is interactive, allowing you to zoom in and out, and hover over nodes to see additional details.

By visualizing your flows, you can gain a clearer understanding of the workflow's structure, making it easier to debug, optimize, and communicate your AI processes to others.

## Advanced

In this section, we explore more complex use cases of CrewAI Flows, starting with a self-evaluation loop. This pattern is crucial for developing AI systems that can iteratively improve their outputs through feedback.

### 1) Self-Evaluation Loop

The self-evaluation loop is a powerful pattern that allows AI workflows to automatically assess and refine their outputs. This example demonstrates how to set up a flow that generates content, evaluates it, and iterates based on feedback until the desired quality is achieved.

#### Overview

The self-evaluation loop involves two main Crews:

1.  **ShakespeareanXPostCrew**: Generates a Shakespearean-style post on a given topic.
2.  **XPostReviewCrew**: Evaluates the generated post, providing feedback on its validity and quality.

The process iterates until the post meets the criteria or a maximum retry limit is reached. This approach ensures high-quality outputs through iterative refinement.

#### Importance

This pattern is essential for building robust AI systems that can adapt and improve over time. By automating the evaluation and feedback loop, developers can ensure that their AI workflows produce reliable and high-quality results.

#### Main Code Highlights

Below is the `main.py` file for the self-evaluation loop flow:

```python
from typing import Optional
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, router, start
from pydantic import BaseModel
from self_evaluation_loop_flow.crews.shakespeare_crew.shakespeare_crew import (
    ShakespeareanXPostCrew,
)
from self_evaluation_loop_flow.crews.x_post_review_crew.x_post_review_crew import (
    XPostReviewCrew,
)

class ShakespeareXPostFlowState(BaseModel):
    x_post: str = ""
    feedback: Optional[str] = None
    valid: bool = False
    retry_count: int = 0

class ShakespeareXPostFlow(Flow[ShakespeareXPostFlowState]):

    @start("retry")
    def generate_shakespeare_x_post(self):
        print("Generating Shakespearean X post")
        topic = "Flying cars"
        result = (
            ShakespeareanXPostCrew()
            .crew()
            .kickoff(inputs={"topic": topic, "feedback": self.state.feedback})
        )
        print("X post generated", result.raw)
        self.state.x_post = result.raw

    @router(generate_shakespeare_x_post)
    def evaluate_x_post(self):
        if self.state.retry_count > 3:
            return "max_retry_exceeded"
        result = XPostReviewCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs={"x_post": self.state.x_post})
        self.state.valid = result["valid"]
        self.state.feedback = result["feedback"]
        print("valid", self.state.valid)
        print("feedback", self.state.feedback)
        self.state.retry_count += 1
        if self.state.valid:
            return "complete"
        return "retry"

    @listen("complete")
    def save_result(self):
        print("X post is valid")
        print("X post:", self.state.x_post)
        with open("x_post.txt", "w") as file:
            file.write(self.state.x_post)

    @listen("max_retry_exceeded")
    def max_retry_exceeded_exit(self):
        print("Max retry count exceeded")
        print("X post:", self.state.x_post)
        print("Feedback:", self.state.feedback)

def kickoff():
    shakespeare_flow = ShakespeareXPostFlow()
    shakespeare_flow.kickoff()

def plot():
    shakespeare_flow = ShakespeareXPostFlow()
    shakespeare_flow.plot()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    kickoff()
```

#### Code Highlights

*   **Retry Mechanism**: The flow uses a retry mechanism to regenerate the post if it doesn't meet the criteria, up to a maximum of three retries.
*   **Feedback Loop**: Feedback from the `XPostReviewCrew` is used to refine the post iteratively.
*   **State Management**: The flow maintains state using a Pydantic model, ensuring type safety and clarity.

# LLMs

Learn how to configure and optimize LLMs for your CrewAI projects.

# Large Language Models (LLMs) in CrewAI

Large Language Models (LLMs) are the backbone of intelligent agents in the CrewAI framework. This guide will help you understand, configure, and optimize LLM usage for your CrewAI projects.

## Key Concepts

*   **LLM**: Large Language Model, the AI powering agent intelligence
*   **Agent**: A CrewAI entity that uses an LLM to perform tasks
*   **Provider**: A service that offers LLM capabilities (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, [more providers](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers))

## Configuring LLMs for Agents

CrewAI offers flexible options for setting up LLMs:

### 1. Default Configuration

By default, CrewAI uses the `gpt-4o-mini` model. It uses environment variables if no LLM is specified:

*   `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME` (defaults to "gpt-4o-mini" if not set)
*   `OPENAI_API_BASE`
*   `OPENAI_API_KEY`

### 2. Updating YAML files

You can update the `agents.yml` file to refer to the LLM you want to use:

```yaml Code
researcher:
    role: Research Specialist
    goal: Conduct comprehensive research and analysis to gather relevant information,
        synthesize findings, and produce well-documented insights.
    backstory: A dedicated research professional with years of experience in academic
        investigation, literature review, and data analysis, known for thorough and
        methodical approaches to complex research questions.
    verbose: true
    llm: openai/gpt-4o
    # llm: azure/gpt-4o-mini
    # llm: gemini/gemini-pro
    # llm: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
    # llm: bedrock/anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0
    # llm: mistral/mistral-large-latest
    # llm: ollama/llama3:70b
    # llm: groq/llama-3.2-90b-vision-preview
    # llm: watsonx/meta-llama/llama-3-1-70b-instruct
    # llm: nvidia_nim/meta/llama3-70b-instruct
    # llm: sambanova/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
    # ...
```

Keep in mind that you will need to set certain ENV vars depending on the model you are
using to account for the credentials or set a custom LLM object like described below.

        base_url="your_api_endpoint"
    )
    agent = Agent(llm=llm, ...)
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Changing the Base API URL

You can change the base API URL for any LLM provider by setting the `base_url` parameter:

```python Code
from crewai import LLM

llm = LLM(
    model="custom-model-name",
    base_url="https://api.your-provider.com/v1",
    api_key="your-api-key"
)
agent = Agent(llm=llm, ...)
```

This is particularly useful when working with OpenAI-compatible APIs or when you need to specify a different endpoint for your chosen provider.

## Best Practices

1.  **Choose the right model**: Balance capability and cost.
2.  **Optimize prompts**: Clear, concise instructions improve output.
3.  **Manage tokens**: Monitor and limit token usage for efficiency.
4.  **Use appropriate temperature**: Lower for factual tasks, higher for creative ones.
5.  **Implement error handling**: Gracefully manage API errors and rate limits.

## Troubleshooting

*   **API Errors**: Check your API key, network connection, and rate limits.
*   **Unexpected Outputs**: Refine your prompts and adjust temperature or top\_p.
*   **Performance Issues**: Consider using a more powerful model or optimizing your queries.
*   **Timeout Errors**: Increase the `timeout` parameter or optimize your input.


# Memory

Leveraging memory systems in the CrewAI framework to enhance agent capabilities.

## Introduction to Memory Systems in CrewAI

The crewAI framework introduces a sophisticated memory system designed to significantly enhance the capabilities of AI agents.
This system comprises `short-term memory`, `long-term memory`, `entity memory`, and `contextual memory`, each serving a unique purpose in aiding agents to remember,
reason, and learn from past interactions.

## Memory System Components

| Component             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Short-Term Memory** | Temporarily stores recent interactions and outcomes using `RAG`, enabling agents to recall and utilize information relevant to their current context during the current executions.                              |
| **Long-Term Memory**  | Preserves valuable insights and learnings from past executions, allowing agents to build and refine their knowledge over time.                                                                                   |
| **Entity Memory**     | Captures and organizes information about entities (people, places, concepts) encountered during tasks, facilitating deeper understanding and relationship mapping. Uses `RAG` for storing entity information.    |
| **Contextual Memory** | Maintains the context of interactions by combining `ShortTermMemory`, `LongTermMemory`, and `EntityMemory`, aiding in the coherence and relevance of agent responses over a sequence of tasks or a conversation. |
| **User Memory**       | Stores user-specific information and preferences, enhancing personalization and user experience.                                                                                                                 |

## How Memory Systems Empower Agents

1.  **Contextual Awareness**: With short-term and contextual memory, agents gain the ability to maintain context over a conversation or task sequence, leading to more coherent and relevant responses.

2.  **Experience Accumulation**: Long-term memory allows agents to accumulate experiences, learning from past actions to improve future decision-making and problem-solving.

3.  **Entity Understanding**: By maintaining entity memory, agents can recognize and remember key entities, enhancing their ability to process and interact with complex information.

## Implementing Memory in Your Crew

When configuring a crew, you can enable and customize each memory component to suit the crew's objectives and the nature of tasks it will perform.
By default, the memory system is disabled, and you can ensure it is active by setting `memory=True` in the crew configuration.
The memory will use OpenAI embeddings by default, but you can change it by setting `embedder` to a different model.
It's also possible to initialize the memory instance with your own instance.

The 'embedder' only applies to **Short-Term Memory** which uses Chroma for RAG.
The **Long-Term Memory** uses SQLite3 to store task results. Currently, there is no way to override these storage implementations.
The data storage files are saved into a platform-specific location found using the appdirs package,
and the name of the project can be overridden using the **CREWAI\_STORAGE\_DIR** environment variable.

### Example: Configuring Memory for a Crew

```python Code
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process

# Assemble your crew with memory capabilities
my_crew = Crew(
    agents=[...],
    tasks=[...],
    process=Process.sequential,
    memory=True,
    verbose=True
)
```

### Example: Use Custom Memory Instances e.g FAISS as the VectorDB

```python Code
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process

# Assemble your crew with memory capabilities
my_crew = Crew(
    agents=[...],
    tasks=[...],
    process="Process.sequential",
    memory=True,
    long_term_memory=EnhanceLongTermMemory(
        storage=LTMSQLiteStorage(
            db_path="/my_data_dir/my_crew1/long_term_memory_storage.db"
        )
    ),
    short_term_memory=EnhanceShortTermMemory(
        storage=CustomRAGStorage(
            crew_name="my_crew",
            storage_type="short_term",
            data_dir="//my_data_dir",
            model=embedder["model"],
            dimension=embedder["dimension"],
        ),
    ),
    entity_memory=EnhanceEntityMemory(
        storage=CustomRAGStorage(
            crew_name="my_crew",
            storage_type="entities",
            data_dir="//my_data_dir",
            model=embedder["model"],
            dimension=embedder["dimension"],
        ),
    ),
    verbose=True,
)
```

## Integrating Mem0 for Enhanced User Memory

[Mem0](https://mem0.ai/) is a self-improving memory layer for LLM applications, enabling personalized AI experiences.

To include user-specific memory you can get your API key [here](https://app.mem0.ai/dashboard/api-keys) and refer the [docs](https://docs.mem0.ai/platform/quickstart#4-1-create-memories) for adding user preferences.

```python Code
import os
from crewai import Crew, Process
from mem0 import MemoryClient

# Set environment variables for Mem0
os.environ["MEM0_API_KEY"] = "m0-xx"

# Step 1: Record preferences based on past conversation or user input
client = MemoryClient()
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi there! I'm planning a vacation and could use some advice."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! I'd be happy to help with your vacation planning. What kind of destination do you prefer?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I am more of a beach person than a mountain person."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's interesting. Do you like hotels or Airbnb?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I like Airbnb more."},
]
client.add(messages, user_id="john")

# Step 2: Create a Crew with User Memory

crew = Crew(
    agents=[...],
    tasks=[...],
    verbose=True,
    process=Process.sequential,
    memory=True,
    memory_config={
        "provider": "mem0",
        "config": {"user_id": "john"},
    },
)
```

## Additional Embedding Providers

### Using OpenAI embeddings (already default)

```python Code

# Planning

Learn how to add planning to your CrewAI Crew and improve their performance.

## Introduction

The planning feature in CrewAI allows you to add planning capability to your crew. When enabled, before each Crew iteration,
all Crew information is sent to an AgentPlanner that will plan the tasks step by step, and this plan will be added to each task description.

### Using the Planning Feature

Getting started with the planning feature is very easy, the only step required is to add `planning=True` to your Crew:

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Code
  from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process

  # Assemble your crew with planning capabilities
  my_crew = Crew(
      agents=self.agents,
      tasks=self.tasks,
      process=Process.sequential,
      planning=True,
  )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

From this point on, your crew will have planning enabled, and the tasks will be planned before each iteration.

#### Planning LLM

Now you can define the LLM that will be used to plan the tasks. You can use any ChatOpenAI LLM model available.

When running the base case example, you will see something like the output below, which represents the output of the `AgentPlanner`
responsible for creating the step-by-step logic to add to the Agents' tasks.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Code
  from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process
  from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

  # Assemble your crew with planning capabilities and custom LLM
  my_crew = Crew(
      agents=self.agents,
      tasks=self.tasks,
      process=Process.sequential,
      planning=True,
      planning_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
  )

  # Run the crew
  my_crew.kickoff()
  ```

# Processes

Detailed guide on workflow management through processes in CrewAI, with updated implementation details.

## Understanding Processes

<Tip>
  Processes orchestrate the execution of tasks by agents, akin to project management in human teams.
  These processes ensure tasks are distributed and executed efficiently, in alignment with a predefined strategy.
</Tip>

## Process Implementations

*   **Sequential**: Executes tasks sequentially, ensuring tasks are completed in an orderly progression.
*   **Hierarchical**: Organizes tasks in a managerial hierarchy, where tasks are delegated and executed based on a structured chain of command. A manager language model (`manager_llm`) or a custom manager agent (`manager_agent`) must be specified in the crew to enable the hierarchical process, facilitating the creation and management of tasks by the manager.
*   **Consensual Process (Planned)**: Aiming for collaborative decision-making among agents on task execution, this process type introduces a democratic approach to task management within CrewAI. It is planned for future development and is not currently implemented in the codebase.

## The Role of Processes in Teamwork

Processes enable individual agents to operate as a cohesive unit, streamlining their efforts to achieve common objectives with efficiency and coherence.

## Assigning Processes to a Crew

To assign a process to a crew, specify the process type upon crew creation to set the execution strategy. For a hierarchical process, ensure to define `manager_llm` or `manager_agent` for the manager agent.

```python
from crewai import Crew
from crewai.process import Process
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Example: Creating a crew with a sequential process
crew = Crew(
    agents=my_agents,
    tasks=my_tasks,
    process=Process.sequential
)

# Example: Creating a crew with a hierarchical process
# Ensure to provide a manager_llm or manager_agent
crew = Crew(
    agents=my_agents,
    tasks=my_tasks,
    process=Process.hierarchical,
    manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")
    # or
    # manager_agent=my_manager_agent
)
```

**Note:** Ensure `my_agents` and `my_tasks` are defined prior to creating a `Crew` object, and for the hierarchical process, either `manager_llm` or `manager_agent` is also required.

## Sequential Process

This method mirrors dynamic team workflows, progressing through tasks in a thoughtful and systematic manner. Task execution follows the predefined order in the task list, with the output of one task serving as context for the next.

To customize task context, utilize the `context` parameter in the `Task` class to specify outputs that should be used as context for subsequent tasks.

## Hierarchical Process

Emulates a corporate hierarchy, CrewAI allows specifying a custom manager agent or automatically creates one, requiring the specification of a manager language model (`manager_llm`). This agent oversees task execution, including planning, delegation, and validation. Tasks are not pre-assigned; the manager allocates tasks to agents based on their capabilities, reviews outputs, and assesses task completion.

## Process Class: Detailed Overview

The `Process` class is implemented as an enumeration (`Enum`), ensuring type safety and restricting process values to the defined types (`sequential`, `hierarchical`). The consensual process is planned for future inclusion, emphasizing our commitment to continuous development and innovation.

## Conclusion

The structured collaboration facilitated by processes within CrewAI is crucial for enabling systematic teamwork among agents.
This documentation has been updated to reflect the latest features, enhancements, and the planned integration of the Consensual Process, ensuring users have access to the most current and comprehensive information.


# Tasks

Detailed guide on managing and creating tasks within the CrewAI framework, reflecting the latest codebase updates.

## Overview of a Task

In the CrewAI framework, a `Task` is a specific assignment completed by an `Agent`.

They provide all necessary details for execution, such as a description, the agent responsible, required tools, and more, facilitating a wide range of action complexities.

Tasks within CrewAI can be collaborative, requiring multiple agents to work together. This is managed through the task properties and orchestrated by the Crew's process, enhancing teamwork and efficiency.

## Creating a Task

Creating a task involves defining its scope, responsible agent, and any additional attributes for flexibility:

```python Code
from crewai import Task

task = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest and most relevant news on AI',
    agent=sales_agent,
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
)
```

<Tip>
  Directly specify an `agent` for assignment or let the `hierarchical` CrewAI's process decide based on roles, availability, etc.
</Tip>

## Task Output

The output of a task in CrewAI framework is encapsulated within the `TaskOutput` class. This class provides a structured way to access results of a task, including various formats such as raw output, JSON, and Pydantic models.

By default, the `TaskOutput` will only include the `raw` output. A `TaskOutput` will only include the `pydantic` or `json_dict` output if the original `Task` object was configured with `output_pydantic` or `output_json`, respectively.

### Task Output Attributes

| Attribute         | Parameters      | Type                       | Description                                                                                        |
| :---------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Description**   | `description`   | `str`                      | Description of the task.                                                                           |
| **Summary**       | `summary`       | `Optional[str]`            | Summary of the task, auto-generated from the first 10 words of the description.                    |
| **Raw**           | `raw`           | `str`                      | The raw output of the task. This is the default format for the output.                             |
| **Pydantic**      | `pydantic`      | `Optional[BaseModel]`      | A Pydantic model object representing the structured output of the task.                            |
| **JSON Dict**     | `json_dict`     | `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` | A dictionary representing the JSON output of the task.                                             |
| **Agent**         | `agent`         | `str`                      | The agent that executed the task.                                                                  |
| **Output Format** | `output_format` | `OutputFormat`             | The format of the task output, with options including RAW, JSON, and Pydantic. The default is RAW. |

### Task Methods and Properties

| Method/Property | Description                                                                                       |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **json**        | Returns the JSON string representation of the task output if the output format is JSON.           |
| **to\_dict**    | Converts the JSON and Pydantic outputs to a dictionary.                                           |
| **str**         | Returns the string representation of the task output, prioritizing Pydantic, then JSON, then raw. |

### Accessing Task Outputs

Once a task has been executed, its output can be accessed through the `output` attribute of the `Task` object. The `TaskOutput` class provides various ways to interact with and present this output.

#### Example

```python Code
# Example task
task = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

# Execute the crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True
)

result = crew.kickoff()

# Accessing the task output
task_output = task.output

print(f"Task Description: {task_output.description}")
print(f"Task Summary: {task_output.summary}")
print(f"Raw Output: {task_output.raw}")
if task_output.json_dict:
    print(f"JSON Output: {json.dumps(task_output.json_dict, indent=2)}")
if task_output.pydantic:
    print(f"Pydantic Output: {task_output.pydantic}")
```

## Integrating Tools with Tasks

Leverage tools from the [CrewAI Toolkit](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai-tools) and [LangChain Tools](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools) for enhanced task performance and agent interaction.

## Creating a Task with Tools

```python Code
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"
os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "Your Key" # serper.dev API key

from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

research_agent = Agent(
  role='Researcher',
  goal='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
  backstory="""You're a researcher at a large company.
  You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights
  to the business.""",
  verbose=True
)

# to perform a semantic search for a specified query from a text's content across the internet
search_tool = SerperDevTool()

task = Task(
  description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
  expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
  agent=research_agent,
  tools=[search_tool]
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True
)

result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```

This demonstrates how tasks with specific tools can override an agent's default set for tailored task execution.

## Referring to Other Tasks

In CrewAI, the output of one task is automatically relayed into the next one, but you can specifically define what tasks' output, including multiple, should be used as context for another task.

This is useful when you have a task that depends on the output of another task that is not performed immediately after it. This is done through the `context` attribute of the task:

```python Code
# ...

research_ai_task = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    async_execution=True,
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

research_ops_task = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI Ops news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI Ops news',
    async_execution=True,
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

write_blog_task = Task(
    description="Write a full blog post about the importance of AI and its latest news",
    expected_output='Full blog post that is 4 paragraphs long',
    agent=writer_agent,
    context=[research_ai_task, research_ops_task]
)

#...
```

## Asynchronous Execution

You can define a task to be executed asynchronously. This means that the crew will not wait for it to be completed to continue with the next task. This is useful for tasks that take a long time to be completed, or that are not crucial for the next tasks to be performed.

You can then use the `context` attribute to define in a future task that it should wait for the output of the asynchronous task to be completed.

```python Code
#...

list_ideas = Task(
    description="List of 5 interesting ideas to explore for an article about AI.",
    expected_output="Bullet point list of 5 ideas for an article.",
    agent=researcher,
    async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

list_important_history = Task(
    description="Research the history of AI and give me the 5 most important events.",
    expected_output="Bullet point list of 5 important events.",
    agent=researcher,
    async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

write_article = Task(
    description="Write an article about AI, its history, and interesting ideas.",
    expected_output="A 4 paragraph article about AI.",
    agent=writer,
    context=[list_ideas, list_important_history] # Will wait for the output of the two tasks to be completed
)

#...
```

## Callback Mechanism

The callback function is executed after the task is completed, allowing for actions or notifications to be triggered based on the task's outcome.

```python Code
# ...

def callback_function(output: TaskOutput):
    # Do something after the task is completed
    # Example: Send an email to the manager
    print(f"""
        Task completed!
        Task: {output.description}
        Output: {output.raw}
    """)

research_task = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool],
    callback=callback_function
)

#...
```

## Accessing a Specific Task Output

Once a crew finishes running, you can access the output of a specific task by using the `output` attribute of the task object:

```python Code
# ...
task1 = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

#...

crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent],
    tasks=[task1, task2, task3],
    verbose=True
)

result = crew.kickoff()

# Returns a TaskOutput object with the description and results of the task
print(f"""
    Task completed!
    Task: {task1.output.description}
    Output: {task1.output.raw}
""")
```

## Tool Override Mechanism

Specifying tools in a task allows for dynamic adaptation of agent capabilities, emphasizing CrewAI's flexibility.

## Error Handling and Validation Mechanisms

While creating and executing tasks, certain validation mechanisms are in place to ensure the robustness and reliability of task attributes. These include but are not limited to:

*   Ensuring only one output type is set per task to maintain clear output expectations.
*   Preventing the manual assignment of the `id` attribute to uphold the integrity of the unique identifier system.

These validations help in maintaining the consistency and reliability of task executions within the crewAI framework.

## Creating Directories when Saving Files

You can now specify if a task should create directories when saving its output to a file. This is particularly useful for organizing outputs and ensuring that file paths are correctly structured.

```python Code
# ...

save_output_task = Task(
    description='Save the summarized AI news to a file',
    expected_output='File saved successfully',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[file_save_tool],
    output_file='outputs/ai_news_summary.txt',
    create_directory=True
)

#...
```

## Conclusion

Tasks are the driving force behind the actions of agents in CrewAI.
By properly defining tasks and their outcomes, you set the stage for your AI agents to work effectively, either independently or as a collaborative unit.
Equipping tasks with appropriate tools, understanding the execution process, and following robust validation practices are crucial for maximizing CrewAI's potential,
ensuring agents are effectively prepared for their assignments and that tasks are executed as intended.


# Testing

Learn how to test your CrewAI Crew and evaluate their performance.

## Introduction

Testing is a crucial part of the development process, and it is essential to ensure that your crew is performing as expected. With crewAI, you can easily test your crew and evaluate its performance using the built-in testing capabilities.

### Using the Testing Feature

We added the CLI command `crewai test` to make it easy to test your crew. This command will run your crew for a specified number of iterations and provide detailed performance metrics. The parameters are `n_iterations` and `model`, which are optional and default to 2 and `gpt-4o-mini` respectively. For now, the only provider available is OpenAI.

```bash
crewai test
```

If you want to run more iterations or use a different model, you can specify the parameters like this:

```bash
crewai test --n_iterations 5 --model gpt-4o
```

or using the short forms:

```bash
crewai test -n 5 -m gpt-4o
```

When you run the `crewai test` command, the crew will be executed for the specified number of iterations, and the performance metrics will be displayed at the end of the run.

A table of scores at the end will show the performance of the crew in terms of the following metrics:

<center>**Tasks Scores (1-10 Higher is better)**</center>

| Tasks/Crew/Agents  | Run 1 | Run 2 | Avg. Total |            Agents            | Additional Info                |
| :----------------- | :---: | :---: | :--------: | :--------------------------: | :----------------------------- |
| Task 1             |  9.0  |  9.5  |   **9.2**  |     Professional Insights    |                                |
|                    |       |       |            |          Researcher          |                                |
| Task 2             |  9.0  |  10.0 |   **9.5**  | Company Profile Investigator |                                |
| Task 3             |  9.0  |  9.0  |   **9.0**  |      Automation Insights     |                                |
|                    |       |       |            |          Specialist          |                                |
| Task 4             |  9.0  |  9.0  |   **9.0**  |     Final Report Compiler    | Automation Insights Specialist |
| Crew               |  9.00 |  9.38 |   **9.2**  |                              |                                |
| Execution Time (s) |  126  |  145  |   **135**  |                              |                                |

The example above shows the test results for two runs of the crew with two tasks, with the average total score for each task and the crew as a whole.

## Creating your own Tools

<Tip>
  Developers can craft `custom tools` tailored for their agent’s needs or
  utilize pre-built options.
</Tip>

There are two main ways for one to create a CrewAI tool:

### Subclassing `BaseTool`

```python Code
from crewai.tools import BaseTool


class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "Name of my tool"
    description: str = "Clear description for what this tool is useful for, your agent will need this information to use it."

    def _run(self, argument: str) -> str:
        # Implementation goes here
        return "Result from custom tool"
```

### Utilizing the `tool` Decorator

```python Code
from crewai.tools import tool
@tool("Name of my tool")
def my_tool(question: str) -> str:
    """Clear description for what this tool is useful for, your agent will need this information to use it."""
    # Function logic here
    return "Result from your custom tool"
```

### Custom Caching Mechanism

<Tip>
  Tools can optionally implement a `cache_function` to fine-tune caching
  behavior. This function determines when to cache results based on specific
  conditions, offering granular control over caching logic.
</Tip>

```python Code
from crewai.tools import tool

@tool
def multiplication_tool(first_number: int, second_number: int) -> str:
    """Useful for when you need to multiply two numbers together."""
    return first_number * second_number

def cache_func(args, result):
    # In this case, we only cache the result if it's a multiple of 2
    cache = result % 2 == 0
    return cache

multiplication_tool.cache_function = cache_func

writer1 = Agent(
        role="Writer",
        goal="You write lessons of math for kids.",
        backstory="You're an expert in writing and you love to teach kids but you know nothing of math.",
        tools=[multiplication_tool],
        allow_delegation=False,
    )
    #...
```

## Conclusion

Tools are pivotal in extending the capabilities of CrewAI agents, enabling them to undertake a broad spectrum of tasks and collaborate effectively.
When building solutions with CrewAI, leverage both custom and existing tools to empower your agents and enhance the AI ecosystem. Consider utilizing error handling,
caching mechanisms, and the flexibility of tool arguments to optimize your agents' performance and capabilities.


# Training

Learn how to train your CrewAI agents by giving them feedback early on and get consistent results.

## Introduction

The training feature in CrewAI allows you to train your AI agents using the command-line interface (CLI).
By running the command `crewai train -n <n_iterations>`, you can specify the number of iterations for the training process.

During training, CrewAI utilizes techniques to optimize the performance of your agents along with human feedback.
This helps the agents improve their understanding, decision-making, and problem-solving abilities.

### Training Your Crew Using the CLI

To use the training feature, follow these steps:

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where your CrewAI project is located.
3.  Run the following command:

```shell
crewai train -n <n_iterations> <filename> (optional)
```

<Tip>
  Replace `<n_iterations>` with the desired number of training iterations and `<filename>` with the appropriate filename ending with `.pkl`.
</Tip>

### Training Your Crew Programmatically

To train your crew programmatically, use the following steps:

1.  Define the number of iterations for training.
2.  Specify the input parameters for the training process.
3.  Execute the training command within a try-except block to handle potential errors.

```python Code
n_iterations = 2
inputs = {"topic": "CrewAI Training"}
filename = "your_model.pkl"

try:
    YourCrewName_Crew().crew().train(
      n_iterations=n_iterations, 
      inputs=inputs, 
      filename=filename
    )

except Exception as e:
    raise Exception(f"An error occurred while training the crew: {e}")
```

### Key Points to Note

*   **Positive Integer Requirement:** Ensure that the number of iterations (`n_iterations`) is a positive integer. The code will raise a `ValueError` if this condition is not met.
*   **Filename Requirement:** Ensure that the filename ends with `.pkl`. The code will raise a `ValueError` if this condition is not met.
*   **Error Handling:** The code handles subprocess errors and unexpected exceptions, providing error messages to the user.

It is important to note that the training process may take some time, depending on the complexity of your agents and will also require your feedback on each iteration.

Once the training is complete, your agents will be equipped with enhanced capabilities and knowledge, ready to tackle complex tasks and provide more consistent and valuable insights.

Remember to regularly update and retrain your agents to ensure they stay up-to-date with the latest information and advancements in the field.

Happy training with CrewAI! 🚀

# Coding Agents

Learn how to enable your CrewAI Agents to write and execute code, and explore advanced features for enhanced functionality.

## Introduction

CrewAI Agents now have the powerful ability to write and execute code, significantly enhancing their problem-solving capabilities. This feature is particularly useful for tasks that require computational or programmatic solutions.

## Enabling Code Execution

To enable code execution for an agent, set the `allow_code_execution` parameter to `True` when creating the agent.

Here's an example:

```python Code
from crewai import Agent

coding_agent = Agent(
    role="Senior Python Developer",
    goal="Craft well-designed and thought-out code",
    backstory="You are a senior Python developer with extensive experience in software architecture and best practices.",
    allow_code_execution=True
)
```

<Note>
  Note that `allow_code_execution` parameter defaults to `False`.
</Note>

## Important Considerations

1.  **Model Selection**: It is strongly recommended to use more capable models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4 when enabling code execution.
    These models have a better understanding of programming concepts and are more likely to generate correct and efficient code.

2.  **Error Handling**: The code execution feature includes error handling. If executed code raises an exception, the agent will receive the error message and can attempt to correct the code or
    provide alternative solutions. The `max_retry_limit` parameter, which defaults to 2, controls the maximum number of retries for a task.

3.  **Dependencies**: To use the code execution feature, you need to install the `crewai_tools` package. If not installed, the agent will log an info message:
    "Coding tools not available. Install crewai\_tools."

## Code Execution Process

When an agent with code execution enabled encounters a task requiring programming:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Task Analysis">
    The agent analyzes the task and determines that code execution is necessary.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Code Formulation">
    It formulates the Python code needed to solve the problem.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Code Execution">
    The code is sent to the internal code execution tool (`CodeInterpreterTool`).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Result Interpretation">
    The agent interprets the result and incorporates it into its response or uses it for further problem-solving.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Usage

Here's a detailed example of creating an agent with code execution capabilities and using it in a task:

```python Code
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Create an agent with code execution enabled
coding_agent = Agent(
    role="Python Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data and provide insights using Python",
    backstory="You are an experienced data analyst with strong Python skills.",
    allow_code_execution=True
)

# Create a task that requires code execution
data_analysis_task = Task(
    description="Analyze the given dataset and calculate the average age of participants.",
    agent=coding_agent
)

# Create a crew and add the task
analysis_crew = Crew(
    agents=[coding_agent],
    tasks=[data_analysis_task]
)

# Execute the crew
result = analysis_crew.kickoff()

print(result)
```

In this example, the `coding_agent` can write and execute Python code to perform data analysis tasks.


# Conditional Tasks

Learn how to use conditional tasks in a crewAI kickoff

## Introduction

Conditional Tasks in crewAI allow for dynamic workflow adaptation based on the outcomes of previous tasks.
This powerful feature enables crews to make decisions and execute tasks selectively, enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of your AI-driven processes.

## Example Usage

```python Code
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel
from crewai import Agent, Crew
from crewai.tasks.conditional_task import ConditionalTask
from crewai.tasks.task_output import TaskOutput
from crewai.task import Task
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

# Define a condition function for the conditional task
# If false, the task will be skipped, if true, then execute the task.
def is_data_missing(output: TaskOutput) -> bool:
    return len(output.pydantic.events) < 10  # this will skip this task

# Define the agents
data_fetcher_agent = Agent(
    role="Data Fetcher",
    goal="Fetch data online using Serper tool",
    backstory="Backstory 1",
    verbose=True,
    tools=[SerperDevTool()]
)

data_processor_agent = Agent(
    role="Data Processor",
    goal="Process fetched data",
    backstory="Backstory 2",
    verbose=True
)

summary_generator_agent = Agent(
    role="Summary Generator",
    goal="Generate summary from fetched data",
    backstory="Backstory 3",
    verbose=True
)

class EventOutput(BaseModel):
    events: List[str]

task1 = Task(
    description="Fetch data about events in San Francisco using Serper tool",
    expected_output="List of 10 things to do in SF this week",
    agent=data_fetcher_agent,
    output_pydantic=EventOutput,
)

conditional_task = ConditionalTask(
    description="""
        Check if data is missing. If we have less than 10 events,
        fetch more events using Serper tool so that
        we have a total of 10 events in SF this week..
        """,
    expected_output="List of 10 Things to do in SF this week",
    condition=is_data_missing,
    agent=data_processor_agent,
)

task3 = Task(
    description="Generate summary of events in San Francisco from fetched data",
    expected_output="A complete report on the customer and their customers and competitors, including their demographics, preferences, market positioning and audience engagement.",
    agent=summary_generator_agent,
)

# Create a crew with the tasks
crew = Crew(
    agents=[data_fetcher_agent, data_processor_agent, summary_generator_agent],
    tasks=[task1, conditional_task, task3],
    verbose=True,
    planning=True
)

# Run the crew
result = crew.kickoff()
print("results", result)
```


# Create Custom Tools

Comprehensive guide on crafting, using, and managing custom tools within the CrewAI framework, including new functionalities and error handling.

## Creating and Utilizing Tools in CrewAI

This guide provides detailed instructions on creating custom tools for the CrewAI framework and how to efficiently manage and utilize these tools,
incorporating the latest functionalities such as tool delegation, error handling, and dynamic tool calling. It also highlights the importance of collaboration tools,
enabling agents to perform a wide range of actions.

### Subclassing `BaseTool`

To create a personalized tool, inherit from `BaseTool` and define the necessary attributes, including the `args_schema` for input validation, and the `_run` method.

```python Code
from typing import Type
from crewai.tools import BaseTool
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class MyToolInput(BaseModel):
    """Input schema for MyCustomTool."""
    argument: str = Field(..., description="Description of the argument.")

class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "Name of my tool"
    description: str = "What this tool does. It's vital for effective utilization."
    args_schema: Type[BaseModel] = MyToolInput

    def _run(self, argument: str) -> str:
        # Your tool's logic here
        return "Tool's result"
```

### Using the `tool` Decorator

Alternatively, you can use the tool decorator `@tool`. This approach allows you to define the tool's attributes and functionality directly within a function,
offering a concise and efficient way to create specialized tools tailored to your needs.

```python Code
from crewai.tools import tool

@tool("Tool Name")
def my_simple_tool(question: str) -> str:
    """Tool description for clarity."""
    # Tool logic here
    return "Tool output"
```

### Defining a Cache Function for the Tool

To optimize tool performance with caching, define custom caching strategies using the `cache_function` attribute.

```python Code
@tool("Tool with Caching")
def cached_tool(argument: str) -> str:
    """Tool functionality description."""
    return "Cacheable result"

def my_cache_strategy(arguments: dict, result: str) -> bool:
    # Define custom caching logic
    return True if some_condition else False

cached_tool.cache_function = my_cache_strategy
```

By adhering to these guidelines and incorporating new functionalities and collaboration tools into your tool creation and management processes,
you can leverage the full capabilities of the CrewAI framework, enhancing both the development experience and the efficiency of your AI agents.

writer = Agent(
    role="Senior Writer",
    goal="Create compelling content about AI and AI agents",
    backstory="You're a senior writer, specialized in technology, software engineering, AI, and startups. You work as a freelancer and are currently writing content for a new client.",
    allow_delegation=False,
)

# Define your task
task = Task(
    description="Generate a list of 5 interesting ideas for an article, then write one captivating paragraph for each idea that showcases the potential of a full article on this topic. Return the list of ideas with their paragraphs and your notes.",
    expected_output="5 bullet points, each with a paragraph and accompanying notes.",
)

# Define the manager agent
manager = Agent(
    role="Project Manager",
    goal="Efficiently manage the crew and ensure high-quality task completion",
    backstory="You're an experienced project manager, skilled in overseeing complex projects and guiding teams to success. Your role is to coordinate the efforts of the crew members, ensuring that each task is completed on time and to the highest standard.",
    allow_delegation=True,
)

# Instantiate your crew with a custom manager
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[task],
    manager_agent=manager,
    process=Process.hierarchical,
)

# Start the crew's work
result = crew.kickoff()
```

## Benefits of a Custom Manager Agent

*   **Enhanced Control**: Tailor the management approach to fit the specific needs of your project.
*   **Improved Coordination**: Ensure efficient task coordination and management by an experienced agent.
*   **Customizable Management**: Define managerial roles and responsibilities that align with your project's goals.

## Setting a Manager LLM

If you're using the hierarchical process and don't want to set a custom manager agent, you can specify the language model for the manager:

```python Code
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

manager_llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4")

crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[task],
    process=Process.hierarchical,
    manager_llm=manager_llm
)
```

<Note>
  Either `manager_agent` or `manager_llm` must be set when using the hierarchical process.
</Note>


# Customize Agents

A comprehensive guide to tailoring agents for specific roles, tasks, and advanced customizations within the CrewAI framework.

## Customizable Attributes

Crafting an efficient CrewAI team hinges on the ability to dynamically tailor your AI agents to meet the unique requirements of any project. This section covers the foundational attributes you can customize.

## Advanced Customization Options

Beyond the basic attributes, CrewAI allows for deeper customization to enhance an agent's behavior and capabilities significantly.

### Language Model Customization

Agents can be customized with specific language models (`llm`) and function-calling language models (`function_calling_llm`), offering advanced control over their processing and decision-making abilities.
It's important to note that setting the `function_calling_llm` allows for overriding the default crew function-calling language model, providing a greater degree of customization.

## Performance and Debugging Settings

Adjusting an agent's performance and monitoring its operations are crucial for efficient task execution.

### Verbose Mode and RPM Limit

*   **Verbose Mode**: Enables detailed logging of an agent's actions, useful for debugging and optimization. Specifically, it provides insights into agent execution processes, aiding in the optimization of performance.
*   **RPM Limit**: Sets the maximum number of requests per minute (`max_rpm`). This attribute is optional and can be set to `None` for no limit, allowing for unlimited queries to external services if needed.

### Maximum Iterations for Task Execution

The `max_iter` attribute allows users to define the maximum number of iterations an agent can perform for a single task, preventing infinite loops or excessively long executions.
The default value is set to 25, providing a balance between thoroughness and efficiency. Once the agent approaches this number, it will try its best to give a good answer.

## Customizing Agents and Tools

Agents are customized by defining their attributes and tools during initialization. Tools are critical for an agent's functionality, enabling them to perform specialized tasks.
The `tools` attribute should be an array of tools the agent can utilize, and it's initialized as an empty list by default. Tools can be added or modified post-agent initialization to adapt to new requirements.

```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

### Example: Assigning Tools to an Agent

```python Code
import os
from crewai import Agent
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

# Set API keys for tool initialization
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"
os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"

# Initialize a search tool
search_tool = SerperDevTool()

# Initialize the agent with advanced options
agent = Agent(
  role='Research Analyst',
  goal='Provide up-to-date market analysis',
  backstory='An expert analyst with a keen eye for market trends.',
  tools=[search_tool],
  memory=True, # Enable memory
  verbose=True,
  max_rpm=None, # No limit on requests per minute
  max_iter=25, # Default value for maximum iterations
)
```

## Delegation and Autonomy

Controlling an agent's ability to delegate tasks or ask questions is vital for tailoring its autonomy and collaborative dynamics within the CrewAI framework. By default,
the `allow_delegation` attribute is now set to `False`, disabling agents to seek assistance or delegate tasks as needed. This default behavior can be changed to promote collaborative problem-solving and
efficiency within the CrewAI ecosystem. If needed, delegation can be enabled to suit specific operational requirements.

### Example: Disabling Delegation for an Agent

```python Code
agent = Agent(
  role='Content Writer',
  goal='Write engaging content on market trends',
  backstory='A seasoned writer with expertise in market analysis.',
  allow_delegation=True # Enabling delegation
)
```

## Conclusion

Customizing agents in CrewAI by setting their roles, goals, backstories, and tools, alongside advanced options like language model customization, memory, performance settings, and delegation preferences,
equips a nuanced and capable AI team ready for complex challenges.


# Force Tool Output as Result

Learn how to force tool output as the result in an Agent's task in CrewAI.

## Introduction

In CrewAI, you can force the output of a tool as the result of an agent's task.
This feature is useful when you want to ensure that the tool output is captured and returned as the task result, avoiding any agent modification during the task execution.

## Forcing Tool Output as Result

To force the tool output as the result of an agent's task, you need to set the `result_as_answer` parameter to `True` when adding a tool to the agent.
This parameter ensures that the tool output is captured and returned as the task result, without any modifications by the agent.

Here's an example of how to force the tool output as the result of an agent's task:

```python Code
from crewai.agent import Agent
from my_tool import MyCustomTool

# Create a coding agent with the custom tool
coding_agent = Agent(
        role="Data Scientist",
        goal="Produce amazing reports on AI",
        backstory="You work with data and AI",
        tools=[MyCustomTool(result_as_answer=True)],
    )

# Assuming the tool's execution and result population occurs within the system
task_result = coding_agent.execute_task(task)
```

## Workflow in Action

<Steps>
  <Step title="Task Execution">
    The agent executes the task using the tool provided.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tool Output">
    The tool generates the output, which is captured as the task result.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Agent Interaction">
    The agent may reflect and take learnings from the tool but the output is not modified.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Result Return">
    The tool output is returned as the task result without any modifications.
  </Step>
</Steps>


# Hierarchical Process

A comprehensive guide to understanding and applying the hierarchical process within your CrewAI projects, updated to reflect the latest coding practices and functionalities.

## Introduction

The hierarchical process in CrewAI introduces a structured approach to task management, simulating traditional organizational hierarchies for efficient task delegation and execution.
This systematic workflow enhances project outcomes by ensuring tasks are handled with optimal efficiency and accuracy.

<Tip>
  The hierarchical process is designed to leverage advanced models like GPT-4, optimizing token usage while handling complex tasks with greater efficiency.
</Tip>

## Hierarchical Process Overview

By default, tasks in CrewAI are managed through a sequential process. However, adopting a hierarchical approach allows for a clear hierarchy in task management,
where a 'manager' agent coordinates the workflow, delegates tasks, and validates outcomes for streamlined and effective execution. This manager agent can now be either
automatically created by CrewAI or explicitly set by the user.

### Key Features

*   **Task Delegation**: A manager agent allocates tasks among crew members based on their roles and capabilities.
*   **Result Validation**: The manager evaluates outcomes to ensure they meet the required standards.
*   **Efficient Workflow**: Emulates corporate structures, providing an organized approach to task management.
*   **System Prompt Handling**: Optionally specify whether the system should use predefined prompts.
*   **Stop Words Control**: Optionally specify whether stop words should be used, supporting various models including the o1 models.
*   **Context Window Respect**: Prioritize important context by enabling respect of the context window, which is now the default behavior.
*   **Delegation Control**: Delegation is now disabled by default to give users explicit control.
*   **Max Requests Per Minute**: Configurable option to set the maximum number of requests per minute.
*   **Max Iterations**: Limit the maximum number of iterations for obtaining a final answer.

## Implementing the Hierarchical Process

To utilize the hierarchical process, it's essential to explicitly set the process attribute to `Process.hierarchical`, as the default behavior is `Process.sequential`.
Define a crew with a designated manager and establish a clear chain of command.

<Tip>
  Assign tools at the agent level to facilitate task delegation and execution by the designated agents under the manager's guidance.
  Tools can also be specified at the task level for precise control over tool availability during task execution.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Configuring the `manager_llm` parameter is crucial for the hierarchical process.
  The system requires a manager LLM to be set up for proper function, ensuring tailored decision-making.
</Tip>

```python Code
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from crewai import Crew, Process, Agent

# Agents are defined with attributes for backstory, cache, and verbose mode
researcher = Agent(
    role='Researcher',
    goal='Conduct in-depth analysis',
    backstory='Experienced data analyst with a knack for uncovering hidden trends.',
    cache=True,
    verbose=False,
    # tools=[]  # This can be optionally specified; defaults to an empty list
    use_system_prompt=True,  # Enable or disable system prompts for this agent
    max_rpm=30,  # Limit on the number of requests per minute
    max_iter=5  # Maximum number of iterations for a final answer
)
writer = Agent(
    role='Writer',
    goal='Create engaging content',
    backstory='Creative writer passionate about storytelling in technical domains.',
    cache=True,
    verbose=False,
    # tools=[]  # Optionally specify tools; defaults to an empty list
    use_system_prompt=True,  # Enable or disable system prompts for this agent
    max_rpm=30,  # Limit on the number of requests per minute
    max_iter=5  # Maximum number of iterations for a final answer
)

# Establishing the crew with a hierarchical process and additional configurations
project_crew = Crew(
    tasks=[...],  # Tasks to be delegated and executed under the manager's supervision
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4"),  # Mandatory if manager_agent is not set
    process=Process.hierarchical,  # Specifies the hierarchical management approach
    respect_context_window=True,  # Enable respect of the context window for tasks
    memory=True,  # Enable memory usage for enhanced task execution
    manager_agent=None,  # Optional: explicitly set a specific agent as manager instead of the manager_llm
    planning=True,  # Enable planning feature for pre-execution strategy
)
```

### Workflow in Action

1.  **Task Assignment**: The manager assigns tasks strategically, considering each agent's capabilities and available tools.
2.  **Execution and Review**: Agents complete their tasks with the option for asynchronous execution and callback functions for streamlined workflows.
3.  **Sequential Task Progression**: Despite being a hierarchical process, tasks follow a logical order for smooth progression, facilitated by the manager's oversight.

## Conclusion

Adopting the hierarchical process in CrewAI, with the correct configurations and understanding of the system's capabilities, facilitates an organized and efficient approach to project management.
Utilize the advanced features and customizations to tailor the workflow to your specific needs, ensuring optimal task execution and project success.


# Human Input on Execution

Integrating CrewAI with human input during execution in complex decision-making processes and leveraging the full capabilities of the agent's attributes and tools.

## Human input in agent execution

Human input is critical in several agent execution scenarios, allowing agents to request additional information or clarification when necessary.
This feature is especially useful in complex decision-making processes or when agents require more details to complete a task effectively.

## Using human input with CrewAI

To integrate human input into agent execution, set the `human_input` flag in the task definition. When enabled, the agent prompts the user for input before delivering its final answer.
This input can provide extra context, clarify ambiguities, or validate the agent's output.

### Example:

```shell
pip install crewai
```

```python Code
import os
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"  # serper.dev API key

# Kickoff Crew Asynchronously

Kickoff a Crew Asynchronously

## Introduction

CrewAI provides the ability to kickoff a crew asynchronously, allowing you to start the crew execution in a non-blocking manner.
This feature is particularly useful when you want to run multiple crews concurrently or when you need to perform other tasks while the crew is executing.

## Asynchronous Crew Execution

To kickoff a crew asynchronously, use the `kickoff_async()` method. This method initiates the crew execution in a separate thread, allowing the main thread to continue executing other tasks.

### Method Signature

```python Code
def kickoff_async(self, inputs: dict) -> CrewOutput:
```

### Parameters

*   `inputs` (dict): A dictionary containing the input data required for the tasks.

### Returns

*   `CrewOutput`: An object representing the result of the crew execution.

## Potential Use Cases

*   **Parallel Content Generation**: Kickoff multiple independent crews asynchronously, each responsible for generating content on different topics. For example, one crew might research and draft an article on AI trends, while another crew generates social media posts about a new product launch. Each crew operates independently, allowing content production to scale efficiently.

*   **Concurrent Market Research Tasks**: Launch multiple crews asynchronously to conduct market research in parallel. One crew might analyze industry trends, while another examines competitor strategies, and yet another evaluates consumer sentiment. Each crew independently completes its task, enabling faster and more comprehensive insights.

*   **Independent Travel Planning Modules**: Execute separate crews to independently plan different aspects of a trip. One crew might handle flight options, another handles accommodation, and a third plans activities. Each crew works asynchronously, allowing various components of the trip to be planned simultaneously and independently for faster results.

## Example: Single Asynchronous Crew Execution

Here's an example of how to kickoff a crew asynchronously using asyncio and awaiting the result:

```python Code
import asyncio
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task

# Create an agent with code execution enabled
coding_agent = Agent(
    role="Python Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data and provide insights using Python",
    backstory="You are an experienced data analyst with strong Python skills.",
    allow_code_execution=True
)

# Create a task that requires code execution
data_analysis_task = Task(
    description="Analyze the given dataset and calculate the average age of participants. Ages: {ages}",
    agent=coding_agent
)

# Create a crew and add the task
analysis_crew = Crew(
    agents=[coding_agent],
    tasks=[data_analysis_task]
)

# Async function to kickoff the crew asynchronously
async def async_crew_execution():
    result = await analysis_crew.kickoff_async(inputs={"ages": [25, 30, 35, 40, 45]})
    print("Crew Result:", result)

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(async_crew_execution())
```

## Example: Multiple Asynchronous Crew Executions

In this example, we'll show how to kickoff multiple crews asynchronously and wait for all of them to complete using `asyncio.gather()`:

```python Code
import asyncio
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task

# Create an agent with code execution enabled
coding_agent = Agent(
    role="Python Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data and provide insights using Python",
    backstory="You are an experienced data analyst with strong Python skills.",
    allow_code_execution=True
)

# Create tasks that require code execution
task_1 = Task(
    description="Analyze the first dataset and calculate the average age of participants. Ages: {ages}",
    agent=coding_agent
)

task_2 = Task(
    description="Analyze the second dataset and calculate the average age of participants. Ages: {ages}",
    agent=coding_agent
)

# Create two crews and add tasks
crew_1 = Crew(agents=[coding_agent], tasks=[task_1])
crew_2 = Crew(agents=[coding_agent], tasks=[task_2])

# Async function to kickoff multiple crews asynchronously and wait for all to finish
async def async_multiple_crews():
    result_1 = crew_1.kickoff_async(inputs={"ages": [25, 30, 35, 40, 45]})
    result_2 = crew_2.kickoff_async(inputs={"ages": [20, 22, 24, 28, 30]})

    # Wait for both crews to finish
    results = await asyncio.gather(result_1, result_2)

    for i, result in enumerate(results, 1):
        print(f"Crew {i} Result:", result)

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(async_multiple_crews())
```


# Kickoff Crew for Each

Kickoff Crew for Each Item in a List

## Introduction

CrewAI provides the ability to kickoff a crew for each item in a list, allowing you to execute the crew for each item in the list.
This feature is particularly useful when you need to perform the same set of tasks for multiple items.

## Kicking Off a Crew for Each Item

To kickoff a crew for each item in a list, use the `kickoff_for_each()` method.
This method executes the crew for each item in the list, allowing you to process multiple items efficiently.

Here's an example of how to kickoff a crew for each item in a list:

```python Code
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task

# Create an agent with code execution enabled
coding_agent = Agent(
    role="Python Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data and provide insights using Python",
    backstory="You are an experienced data analyst with strong Python skills.",
    allow_code_execution=True
)

# Create a task that requires code execution
data_analysis_task = Task(
    description="Analyze the given dataset and calculate the average age of participants. Ages: {ages}",
    agent=coding_agent,
    expected_output="The average age calculated from the dataset"
)

# Create a crew and add the task
analysis_crew = Crew(
    agents=[coding_agent],
    tasks=[data_analysis_task],
    verbose=True,
    memory=False,
    respect_context_window=True  # enable by default
)

datasets = [

# Agent Monitoring with Langtrace

How to monitor cost, latency, and performance of CrewAI Agents using Langtrace, an external observability tool.

# Langtrace Overview

Langtrace is an open-source, external tool that helps you set up observability and evaluations for Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM frameworks, and Vector Databases.
While not built directly into CrewAI, Langtrace can be used alongside CrewAI to gain deep visibility into the cost, latency, and performance of your CrewAI Agents.
This integration allows you to log hyperparameters, monitor performance regressions, and establish a process for continuous improvement of your Agents.

# Replay Tasks from Latest Crew Kickoff

Replay tasks from the latest crew.kickoff(...)

## Introduction

CrewAI provides the ability to replay from a task specified from the latest crew kickoff. This feature is particularly useful when you've finished a kickoff and may want to retry certain tasks or don't need to refetch data over and your agents already have the context saved from the kickoff execution so you just need to replay the tasks you want to.

<Note>
  You must run `crew.kickoff()` before you can replay a task.
  Currently, only the latest kickoff is supported, so if you use `kickoff_for_each`, it will only allow you to replay from the most recent crew run.
</Note>

Here's an example of how to replay from a task:

### Replaying from Specific Task Using the CLI

To use the replay feature, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your terminal or command prompt." />

  <Step title="Navigate to the directory where your CrewAI project is located." />

  <Step title="Run the following commands:">
    To view the latest kickoff task\_ids use:

    ```shell
    crewai log-tasks-outputs
    ```

    Once you have your `task_id` to replay, use:

    ```shell
    crewai replay -t <task_id>
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Ensure `crewai` is installed and configured correctly in your development environment.
</Note>

### Replaying from a Task Programmatically

To replay from a task programmatically, use the following steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Specify the `task_id` and input parameters for the replay process.">
    Specify the `task_id` and input parameters for the replay process.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute the replay command within a try-except block to handle potential errors.">
    Execute the replay command within a try-except block to handle potential errors.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```python Code
        def replay():
        """
        Replay the crew execution from a specific task.
        """
        task_id = '<task_id>'
        inputs = {"topic": "CrewAI Training"}  # This is optional; you can pass in the inputs you want to replay; otherwise, it uses the previous kickoff's inputs.
        try:
            YourCrewName_Crew().crew().replay(task_id=task_id, inputs=inputs)

        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            raise Exception(f"An error occurred while replaying the crew: {e}")

        except Exception as e:
            raise Exception(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Conclusion

With the above enhancements and detailed functionality, replaying specific tasks in CrewAI has been made more efficient and robust.
Ensure you follow the commands and steps precisely to make the most of these features.


# Sequential Processes

A comprehensive guide to utilizing the sequential processes for task execution in CrewAI projects.

## Introduction

CrewAI offers a flexible framework for executing tasks in a structured manner, supporting both sequential and hierarchical processes.
This guide outlines how to effectively implement these processes to ensure efficient task execution and project completion.

## Sequential Process Overview

The sequential process ensures tasks are executed one after the other, following a linear progression.
This approach is ideal for projects requiring tasks to be completed in a specific order.

### Key Features

*   **Linear Task Flow**: Ensures orderly progression by handling tasks in a predetermined sequence.
*   **Simplicity**: Best suited for projects with clear, step-by-step tasks.
*   **Easy Monitoring**: Facilitates easy tracking of task completion and project progress.

## Implementing the Sequential Process

To use the sequential process, assemble your crew and define tasks in the order they need to be executed.

```python Code
from crewai import Crew, Process, Agent, Task, TaskOutput, CrewOutput

# Define your agents
researcher = Agent(
  role='Researcher',
  goal='Conduct foundational research',
  backstory='An experienced researcher with a passion for uncovering insights'
)
analyst = Agent(
  role='Data Analyst',
  goal='Analyze research findings',
  backstory='A meticulous analyst with a knack for uncovering patterns'
)
writer = Agent(
  role='Writer',
  goal='Draft the final report',
  backstory='A skilled writer with a talent for crafting compelling narratives'
)

# Define your tasks
research_task = Task(
  description='Gather relevant data...', 
  agent=researcher, 
  expected_output='Raw Data'
)
analysis_task = Task(
  description='Analyze the data...', 
  agent=analyst, 
  expected_output='Data Insights'
)
writing_task = Task(
  description='Compose the report...', 
  agent=writer, 
  expected_output='Final Report'
)

# Form the crew with a sequential process
report_crew = Crew(
  agents=[researcher, analyst, writer],
  tasks=[research_task, analysis_task, writing_task],
  process=Process.sequential
)

# Execute the crew
result = report_crew.kickoff()

# Accessing the type-safe output
task_output: TaskOutput = result.tasks[0].output
crew_output: CrewOutput = result.output
```

### Note:

Each task in a sequential process **must** have an agent assigned. Ensure that every `Task` includes an `agent` parameter.

### Workflow in Action

1.  **Initial Task**: In a sequential process, the first agent completes their task and signals completion.
2.  **Subsequent Tasks**: Agents pick up their tasks based on the process type, with outcomes of preceding tasks or directives guiding their execution.
3.  **Completion**: The process concludes once the final task is executed, leading to project completion.

## Advanced Features

### Task Delegation

In sequential processes, if an agent has `allow_delegation` set to `True`, they can delegate tasks to other agents in the crew.
This feature is automatically set up when there are multiple agents in the crew.

### Asynchronous Execution

Tasks can be executed asynchronously, allowing for parallel processing when appropriate.
To create an asynchronous task, set `async_execution=True` when defining the task.

### Memory and Caching

CrewAI supports both memory and caching features:

*   **Memory**: Enable by setting `memory=True` when creating the Crew. This allows agents to retain information across tasks.
*   **Caching**: By default, caching is enabled. Set `cache=False` to disable it.

### Callbacks

You can set callbacks at both the task and step level:

*   `task_callback`: Executed after each task completion.
*   `step_callback`: Executed after each step in an agent's execution.

### Usage Metrics

CrewAI tracks token usage across all tasks and agents. You can access these metrics after execution.

## Best Practices for Sequential Processes

1.  **Order Matters**: Arrange tasks in a logical sequence where each task builds upon the previous one.
2.  **Clear Task Descriptions**: Provide detailed descriptions for each task to guide the agents effectively.
3.  **Appropriate Agent Selection**: Match agents' skills and roles to the requirements of each task.
4.  **Use Context**: Leverage the context from previous tasks to inform subsequent ones.

This updated documentation ensures that details accurately reflect the latest changes in the codebase and clearly describes how to leverage new features and configurations.
The content is kept simple and direct to ensure easy understanding.

# Quickstart

Build your first AI agent with CrewAI in under 5 minutes.

## Build your first CrewAI Agent

Let's create a simple crew that will help us `research` and `report` on the `latest AI developments` for a given topic or subject.

Before we proceed, make sure you have `crewai` and `crewai-tools` installed.
If you haven't installed them yet, you can do so by following the [installation guide](/installation).

Follow the steps below to get crewing! 🚣‍♂️

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your crew">
    Create a new crew project by running the following command in your terminal.
    This will create a new directory called `latest-ai-development` with the basic structure for your crew.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell Terminal
      crewai create crew latest-ai-development
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Modify your `agents.yaml` file">
    <Tip>
      You can also modify the agents as needed to fit your use case or copy and paste as is to your project.
      Any variable interpolated in your `agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml` files like `{topic}` will be replaced by the value of the variable in the `main.py` file.
    </Tip>

    ```yaml agents.yaml
    # src/latest_ai_development/config/agents.yaml

          agents=self.agents, # Automatically created by the @agent decorator
          tasks=self.tasks, # Automatically created by the @task decorator
          process=Process.sequential,
          verbose=True,
        ) 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Feel free to pass custom inputs to your crew">
    For example, you can pass the `topic` input to your crew to customize the research and reporting.

    ```python main.py
    #!/usr/bin/env python

    def run():
      """
      Run the crew.
      """
      inputs = {
        'topic': 'AI Agents'
      }
      LatestAiDevelopmentCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set your environment variables">
    Before running your crew, make sure you have the following keys set as environment variables in your `.env` file:

    *   An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) (or other LLM API key): `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
    *   A [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev/) API key: `SERPER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Lock and install the dependencies">
    Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command but first, navigate to your project directory:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```shell Terminal
      cd latest-ai-development
      crewai install
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run your crew">
    To run your crew, execute the following command in the root of your project:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Terminal
      crewai run
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="View your final report">
    You should see the output in the console and the `report.md` file should be created in the root of your project with the final report.

### Note on Consistency in Naming

The names you use in your YAML files (`agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml`) should match the method names in your Python code.
For example, you can reference the agent for specific tasks from `tasks.yaml` file.
This naming consistency allows CrewAI to automatically link your configurations with your code; otherwise, your task won't recognize the reference properly.

#### Example References

<Tip>
  Note how we use the same name for the agent in the `agents.yaml` (`email_summarizer`) file as the method name in the `crew.py` (`email_summarizer`) file.
</Tip>

```yaml agents.yaml
email_summarizer:
    role: >
      Email Summarizer
    goal: >
      Summarize emails into a concise and clear summary
    backstory: >
      You will create a 5 bullet point summary of the report
    llm: mixtal_llm
```

<Tip>
  Note how we use the same name for the agent in the `tasks.yaml` (`email_summarizer_task`) file as the method name in the `crew.py` (`email_summarizer_task`) file.
</Tip>

```yaml tasks.yaml
email_summarizer_task:
    description: >
      Summarize the email into a 5 bullet point summary
    expected_output: >
      A 5 bullet point summary of the email
    agent: email_summarizer
    context:
      - reporting_task
      - research_task
```

Use the annotations to properly reference the agent and task in the `crew.py` file.

### Annotations include:

*   `@agent`
*   `@task`
*   `@crew`
*   `@tool`
*   `@callback`
*   `@output_json`
*   `@output_pydantic`
*   `@cache_handler`

```python crew.py
# ...
@agent
def email_summarizer(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
        config=self.agents_config["email_summarizer"],
    )

@task
def email_summarizer_task(self) -> Task:
    return Task(
        config=self.tasks_config["email_summarizer_task"],
    )
# ...
```

<Tip>
  In addition to the [sequential process](../how-to/sequential-process), you can use the [hierarchical process](../how-to/hierarchical-process),
  which automatically assigns a manager to the defined crew to properly coordinate the planning and execution of tasks through delegation and validation of results.
  You can learn more about the core concepts [here](/concepts).
</Tip>

### Replay Tasks from Latest Crew Kickoff

CrewAI now includes a replay feature that allows you to list the tasks from the last run and replay from a specific one. To use this feature, run.

```shell
crewai replay <task_id>
```

Replace `<task_id>` with the ID of the task you want to replay.

### Reset Crew Memory

If you need to reset the memory of your crew before running it again, you can do so by calling the reset memory feature:

```shell
crewai reset-memory
```

This will clear the crew's memory, allowing for a fresh start.

## Deploying Your Project

The easiest way to deploy your crew is through [CrewAI Enterprise](http://app.crewai.com/), where you can deploy your crew in a few clicks.


# Telemetry

Understanding the telemetry data collected by CrewAI and how it contributes to the enhancement of the library.

## Telemetry

<Note>
  By default, we collect no data that would be considered personal information under GDPR and other privacy regulations.
  We do collect Tool's names and Agent's roles, so be advised not to include any personal information in the tool's names or the Agent's roles.
  Because no personal information is collected, it's not necessary to worry about data residency.
  When `share_crew` is enabled, additional data is collected which may contain personal information if included by the user.
  Users should exercise caution when enabling this feature to ensure compliance with privacy regulations.
</Note>

CrewAI utilizes anonymous telemetry to gather usage statistics with the primary goal of enhancing the library.
Our focus is on improving and developing the features, integrations, and tools most utilized by our users.

It's pivotal to understand that by default, **NO personal data is collected** concerning prompts, task descriptions, agents' backstories or goals,
usage of tools, API calls, responses, any data processed by the agents, or secrets and environment variables.
When the `share_crew` feature is enabled, detailed data including task descriptions, agents' backstories or goals, and other specific attributes are collected
to provide deeper insights. This expanded data collection may include personal information if users have incorporated it into their crews or tasks.
Users should carefully consider the content of their crews and tasks before enabling `share_crew`.
Users can disable telemetry by setting the environment variable `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED` to `true`.

# Code Docs RAG Search

The `CodeDocsSearchTool` is a powerful RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) tool designed for semantic searches within code documentation.

# `CodeDocsSearchTool`

<Note>
  **Experimental**: We are still working on improving tools, so there might be unexpected behavior or changes in the future.
</Note>

## Description

The CodeDocsSearchTool is a powerful RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) tool designed for semantic searches within code documentation.
It enables users to efficiently find specific information or topics within code documentation. By providing a `docs_url` during initialization,
the tool narrows down the search to that particular documentation site. Alternatively, without a specific `docs_url`,
it searches across a wide array of code documentation known or discovered throughout its execution, making it versatile for various documentation search needs.

## Installation

To start using the CodeDocsSearchTool, first, install the crewai\_tools package via pip:

```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

## Example

Utilize the CodeDocsSearchTool as follows to conduct searches within code documentation:

```python Code
from crewai_tools import CodeDocsSearchTool

# To search any code documentation content 
# if the URL is known or discovered during its execution:
tool = CodeDocsSearchTool()

# OR

# To specifically focus your search on a given documentation site 
# by providing its URL:
tool = CodeDocsSearchTool(docs_url='https://docs.example.com/reference')
```

<Note>
  Substitute '[https://docs.example.com/reference](https://docs.example.com/reference)' with your target documentation URL
  and 'How to use search tool' with the search query relevant to your needs.
</Note>

## Arguments

The following parameters can be used to customize the `CodeDocsSearchTool`'s behavior:

| Argument      | Type     | Description                                                             |
| :------------ | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **docs\_url** | `string` | *Optional*. Specifies the URL of the code documentation to be searched. |

## Custom model and embeddings

By default, the tool uses OpenAI for both embeddings and summarization. To customize the model, you can use a config dictionary as follows:

```python Code
tool = CodeDocsSearchTool(
    config=dict(
        llm=dict(
            provider="ollama", # or google, openai, anthropic, llama2, ...
            config=dict(
                model="llama2",
                # temperature=0.5,
                # top_p=1,
                # stream=true,
            ),
        ),
        embedder=dict(
            provider="google", # or openai, ollama, ...
            config=dict(
                model="models/embedding-001",
                task_type="retrieval_document",
                # title="Embeddings",
            ),
        ),
    )
)
```


# Code Interpreter

The `CodeInterpreterTool` is a powerful tool designed for executing Python 3 code within a secure, isolated environment.

# `CodeInterpreterTool`

## Description

This tool enables the Agent to execute Python 3 code that it has generated autonomously. The code is run in a secure, isolated environment, ensuring safety regardless of the content.

This functionality is particularly valuable as it allows the Agent to create code, execute it within the same ecosystem,
obtain the results, and utilize that information to inform subsequent decisions and actions.

## Requirements

*   Docker

## Installation

Install the `crewai_tools` package

```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

## Example

Remember that when using this tool, the code must be generated by the Agent itself.
The code must be a Python3 code. And it will take some time for the first time to run
because it needs to build the Docker image.

```python Code
from crewai import Agent
from crewai_tools import CodeInterpreterTool

Agent(
    ...
    tools=[CodeInterpreterTool()],
)
```

We also provide a simple way to use it directly from the Agent.

```python Code
from crewai import Agent

agent = Agent(
    ...
    allow_code_execution=True,
)
```

# NL2SQL Tool

The `NL2SQLTool` is designed to convert natural language to SQL queries.

# `NL2SQLTool`

## Description

This tool is used to convert natural language to SQL queries. When passsed to the agent it will generate queries and then use them to interact with the database.

This enables multiple workflows like having an Agent to access the database fetch information based on the goal and then use the information to generate a response, report or any other output.
Along with that proivdes the ability for the Agent to update the database based on its goal.

**Attention**: Make sure that the Agent has access to a Read-Replica or that is okay for the Agent to run insert/update queries on the database.

## Requirements

*   SqlAlchemy
*   Any DB compatible library (e.g. psycopg2, mysql-connector-python)

## Installation

Install the crewai\_tools package

```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

## Usage

In order to use the NL2SQLTool, you need to pass the database URI to the tool. The URI should be in the format `dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database`.

```python Code
from crewai_tools import NL2SQLTool

# psycopg2 was installed to run this example with PostgreSQL
nl2sql = NL2SQLTool(db_uri="postgresql://example@localhost:5432/test_db")

@agent
def researcher(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
        config=self.agents_config["researcher"],
        allow_delegation=False,
        tools=[nl2sql]
    )
```

## Example

The primary task goal was:

"Retrieve the average, maximum, and minimum monthly revenue for each city, but only include cities that have more than one user. Also, count the number of user in each city and
sort the results by the average monthly revenue in descending order"

So the Agent tried to get information from the DB, the first one is wrong so the Agent tries again and gets the correct information and passes to the next agent.

![alt text](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/blob/main/crewai_tools/tools/nl2sql/images/image-2.png?raw=true)
![alt text](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/raw/main/crewai_tools/tools/nl2sql/images/image-3.png)

The second task goal was:

"Review the data and create a detailed report, and then create the table on the database with the fields based on the data provided.
Include information on the average, maximum, and minimum monthly revenue for each city, but only include cities that have more than one user. Also, count the number of users in each city and sort the results by the average monthly revenue in descending order."

Now things start to get interesting, the Agent generates the SQL query to not only create the table but also insert the data into the table. And in the end the Agent still returns the final report which is exactly what was in the database.

![alt text](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/raw/main/crewai_tools/tools/nl2sql/images/image-4.png)

![alt text](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/raw/main/crewai_tools/tools/nl2sql/images/image-7.png)

This is a simple example of how the NL2SQLTool can be used to interact with the database and generate reports based on the data in the database.

The Tool provides endless possibilities on the logic of the Agent and how it can interact with the database.

This command will download and install the TXTSearchTool along with any necessary dependencies.

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to use the TXTSearchTool to search within a text file.
This example shows both the initialization of the tool with a specific text file and the subsequent search within that file's content.

```python Code
from crewai_tools import TXTSearchTool

# Initialize the tool to search within any text file's content 
# the agent learns about during its execution
tool = TXTSearchTool()

# OR

# Initialize the tool with a specific text file, 
# so the agent can search within the given text file's content
tool = TXTSearchTool(txt='path/to/text/file.txt')
```

## Arguments

*   `txt` (str): **Optional**. The path to the text file you want to search.
    This argument is only required if the tool was not initialized with a specific text file;
    otherwise, the search will be conducted within the initially provided text file.

  The WebsiteSearchTool is currently in an experimental phase. We are actively working on incorporating this tool into our suite of offerings and will update the documentation accordingly.
</Note>

## Description

The WebsiteSearchTool is designed as a concept for conducting semantic searches within the content of websites.
It aims to leverage advanced machine learning models like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to navigate and extract information from specified URLs efficiently.
This tool intends to offer flexibility, allowing users to perform searches across any website or focus on specific websites of interest.
Please note, the current implementation details of the WebsiteSearchTool are under development, and its functionalities as described may not yet be accessible.

## Installation

To prepare your environment for when the WebsiteSearchTool becomes available, you can install the foundational package with:

```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

This command installs the necessary dependencies to ensure that once the tool is fully integrated, users can start using it immediately.

## Example Usage

Below are examples of how the WebsiteSearchTool could be utilized in different scenarios. Please note, these examples are illustrative and represent planned functionality:

```python Code
from crewai_tools import WebsiteSearchTool

# Example of initiating tool that agents can use 
# to search across any discovered websites
tool = WebsiteSearchTool()

# Example of limiting the search to the content of a specific website, 
# so now agents can only search within that website
tool = WebsiteSearchTool(website='https://example.com')
```

## Arguments

*   `website`: An optional argument intended to specify the website URL for focused searches. This argument is designed to enhance the tool's flexibility by allowing targeted searches when necessary.

## Customization Options

By default, the tool uses OpenAI for both embeddings and summarization. To customize the model, you can use a config dictionary as follows:

```python Code
tool = WebsiteSearchTool(
    config=dict(
        llm=dict(
            provider="ollama", # or google, openai, anthropic, llama2, ...
            config=dict(
                model="llama2",
                # temperature=0.5,
                # top_p=1,
                # stream=true,
            ),
        ),
        embedder=dict(
            provider="google", # or openai, ollama, ...
            config=dict(
                model="models/embedding-001",
                task_type="retrieval_document",
                # title="Embeddings",
            ),
        ),
    )
)
```

The `XMLSearchTool` is designed to perform a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) search within the content of a XML file.

# `XMLSearchTool`

<Note>
  We are still working on improving tools, so there might be unexpected behavior or changes in the future.
</Note>

## Description

The XMLSearchTool is a cutting-edge RAG tool engineered for conducting semantic searches within XML files.
Ideal for users needing to parse and extract information from XML content efficiently, this tool supports inputting a search query and an optional XML file path.
By specifying an XML path, users can target their search more precisely to the content of that file, thereby obtaining more relevant search outcomes.

## Installation

To start using the XMLSearchTool, you must first install the crewai\_tools package. This can be easily done with the following command:

```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

## Example

Here are two examples demonstrating how to use the XMLSearchTool.
The first example shows searching within a specific XML file, while the second example illustrates initiating a search without predefining an XML path, providing flexibility in search scope.

```python Code
from crewai_tools import XMLSearchTool

# Allow agents to search within any XML file's content 
#as it learns about their paths during execution
tool = XMLSearchTool()

# OR

# Initialize the tool with a specific XML file path 
#for exclusive search within that document
tool = XMLSearchTool(xml='path/to/your/xmlfile.xml')
```

## Arguments

*   `xml`: This is the path to the XML file you wish to search.
    It is an optional parameter during the tool's initialization but must be provided either at initialization or as part of the `run` method's arguments to execute a search.

## Custom model and embeddings

By default, the tool uses OpenAI for both embeddings and summarization. To customize the model, you can use a config dictionary as follows:

```python Code  
tool = XMLSearchTool(
    config=dict(
        llm=dict(
            provider="ollama", # or google, openai, anthropic, llama2, ...
            config=dict(
                model="llama2",
                # temperature=0.5,
                # top_p=1,
                # stream=true,
            ),
        ),
        embedder=dict(
            provider="google", # or openai, ollama, ...
            config=dict(
                model="models/embedding-001",
                task_type="retrieval_document",
                # title="Embeddings",
            ),
        ),
    )
